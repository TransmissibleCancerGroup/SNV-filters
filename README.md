# SNV filters
Somatypus post-processing pipeline.

1. Homozygous-in-reference filter.
SNVs called with VAF > 0.9 in reference sample are discarded.

2. Strand bias filter.
In regions with total coverage â‰¥ 11 across all samples, we reject variant calls with less than 20 % support on either forward or reverse sequencing strands. In regions with total coverage < 11 reads across all samples, we remove variants that had less than two supporting reads in either forward or reverse direction.

3. Simple repeats regions filter.
SNVs lying within a 5 BP window around a simple repeat regions, as annotated by Tandem Repeat Finder, are discarded.

4. Regions filter.
The Tasmanian devil reference genome (Devil7.1) is a scaffold-level assembly, consisting of 237,291 contigs assembled into 35,974 scaffolds. We reject any variant mapping within 500 BP from the start or end of a contig, or within 1000 BP from the start of end of a scaffold.
